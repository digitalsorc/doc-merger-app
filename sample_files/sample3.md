# Sample Document 3: With Front Matter

This document includes YAML front matter to test front matter handling.

## What is Front Matter?

Front matter is metadata at the beginning of a markdown file, typically in YAML format.

```yaml
---
title: My Document
author: John Doe
---
```

## Processing Options

The merger can:

- **Strip front matter**: Remove it from output
- **Preserve front matter**: Keep it as-is
- **Convert to metadata**: Transform into document metadata section

## Example Content

Here's some regular markdown content:

- List item one
- List item two
- List item three

**Bold text** and *italic text* work normally.

## Links and Images

You can include [links](https://example.com) and images in your documents.

## Final Notes

This completes the front matter example.
